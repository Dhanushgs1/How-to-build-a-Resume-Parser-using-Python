        "A Resume Parser is a valuable tool for HR professionals and organizations looking to streamline their recruitment process. It automates the extraction of key information from resumes, making it easier to manage and analyze candidate data. These are helpful in shortlisting candidates based on certain criteria without the hectic task of going through each Resume manually and evaluating it. In this post, we will guide you in creating a Resume Parser from scratch and extracting key information from a typical candidate Resume using Python Programming.\n",
